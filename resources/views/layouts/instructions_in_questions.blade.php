							<ul class="custom-list-style">
								<li><button type="button" class="btn btn-unsolved btn-circle"></button>You have not visited the question yet
								</li>
								<li><button type="button" class="btn btn-danger btn-circle"></button>You have not answered the question.</li>
								<li><button type="button" class="btn btn-success btn-circle"></button>You have answered the question.</li>
								<li><button type="button" class="btn btn-voilate btn-circle"></button>Marked the question for review.</li>
							</ul>
							<li>3. The Marked for Review status for a question simply indicates that you would like to look at that question again. If a question is answered, but marked for review, then the answer to that question will be considered in the evaluation, unless the status is modified by the candidate.
